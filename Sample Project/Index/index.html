        <h1>FOOD DELIVERY </h1>
    <p>
      Thanks to the food delivery apps, you can now get your
       favourite burger delivered to your doorstep from your
        choice of restaurant in town. Online food delivery  
        platforms are expanding choice and convenience along
         with great deals and discounts, allowing customers 
         to order from a wide array of restaurants with a 
         single tap of their mobile phone. As a result,
          the food delivery business is fast catching up
           across markets of America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

         According to “Online Food Delivery Services Global Market
          Report 2020-30”, the global online food delivery services 
          market is expected to grow from USD111.32 billion in 2020
           at a growth rate of 3.61%. However, 2020’s growth slump 
           is mainly due to the economic slowdown across countries 
           owing to the pandemic outbreak and the measures to contain
            it. The market is still expected to grow and reach USD154.
